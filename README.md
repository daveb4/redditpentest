# Reddit Penetration Testing
Penetration testing for knockoff Reddit web apps using Google's Firebase database and OAuth. One write up is for my personal Reddit knockoff and the other is for the Reddit app made by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton.

## Write up analyzing [Reddit web app by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton](https://daddit.sbenton.net/) for vulnerabilities.

After spending some time searching through the app, I was unable to find any significant vulnerabilities but I will list some of the tests I did along with screenshots. I will also comment on the UX design at the end.
