# Reddit Penetration Testing
Penetration testing for knockoff Reddit web apps using Google's Firebase database and OAuth. One write up is for my personal Reddit knockoff and the other is for the Reddit app made by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton.

## Write up analyzing the [Daddit web app by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton](https://daddit.sbenton.net/) for vulnerabilities.

After spending some time searching through the app, I was unable to find any significant vulnerabilities after poking around but I will list some of the tests I did along with screenshots. I mainly focused on being able to make changes while signed out. I will also comment on the UX design at the end.

### Test 1: Upvoting
I played around with upvoting for a while and came to the conclusion that the upvote system is well implemented. I was able to upvote or downvote only once and could switch my upvote to a downvote, switch my downvote to an upvote, or remove my vote. I messed around with the console and found no luck changing the number. I checked the cookies and found nothing I could work with. The only way to change the upvote number outside of my priveledges that I found was to sign out and vote. After signing out, I was able to cast another vote. So that was the only problem I found with the upvote system.

### Test 2: Commenting
I found no flaws in the commenting implementation. I could comment on each discussion while signed in and I could reply to replies easily. When I signed out, it seemed like I could comment but when I tried to submit the comment, the process never completed. When I checked the console, I saw the error shown in the image below. I took a peek at the database and saw no changes either.

### Test 3: Creating a Discussion
Similarly to the commenting system, I found no problems with making a new discussion or "kid". It worked while I was signed in and gave me an error when I was signed out. The error was the same as the error from the comment. When the creation of a comment or discussion is done it needs an author associated with the ID, seemingly.

### Test 4: Early Line Termination
The first test I did was testing if I could terminate the code early to test for input sanitization. I had no luck in making any code injections.

### UX Design
The design of the website is really well done. It looks nice and the interface is pretty simple to interact with. I have to nitpick to pick out some of the things I think could be updated. One thing I can mention is the lack of error messages. When things go wrong, I need to figure out why with the error messages in the console. Also, an option to delete a post or comment might be a nice touch. The only other thing I can think of is changing the color of the upvote button after it's selected. It's a little too dark and too close to the unselected coler, in my opinion. Other than that I think the website looks great.

## Write analyzing the [Redddit web app by me](https://seddit-e3b74.firebaseapp.com/) for vulnerabilities.

I revisted my poorly made web app after some time away from it (I looked at it during the break and a few of the days after then didn't touch it until Tuesday), and it appears that the other team found a vulnerability.

Unfortunately I don't have a database backup but I think it could have been a vulnerability that I had found earlier.

### Vulnerability: Javascript injection
In the create post section, the user first creates a title and text for the post, then they input an image URL.

If you inject code along the lines of :
```
a console.log("Hello")
```
Then you can execute whatever javascript you want.

### UX Design
As I had noted before, the web app needs an overhaul. The updates aren't realtime, the comments don't work, the votes have no limits, there's no user picture or anything when signed in, and it looks pretty bad.
