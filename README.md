# Reddit Penetration Testing
Penetration testing for knockoff Reddit web apps using Google's Firebase database and OAuth. One write up is for my personal Reddit knockoff and the other is for the Reddit app made by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton.

## Write up analyzing [Reddit web app by Sophia Freaney and Scott Benton](https://daddit.sbenton.net/) for vulnerabilities.

After spending some time searching through the app, I was unable to find any significant vulnerabilities after poking around but I will list some of the tests I did along with screenshots. I mainly focused on being able to make changes while signed out. I will also comment on the UX design at the end.

### Test 1: Upvoting
I played around with upvoting for a while and came to the conclusion that the upvote system is well implemented. I was able to upvote or downvote only once and could switch my upvote to a downvote, switch my downvote to an upvote, or remove my vote. I messed around with the console and found no luck changing the number. I checked the cookies and found nothing I could work with. The only way to change the upvote number outside of my priveledges that I found was to sign out and vote. After signing out, I was able to cast another vote. So that was the only problem I found with the upvote system.

### Test 2: Commenting
I found no flaws in the commenting implementation. I could comment on each discussion while signed in and I could reply to replies easily. When I signed out, it seemed like I could comment but when I tried to submit the comment, the process never completed. When I checked the console, I saw the error shown in the image below. I took a peek at the database and saw no changes either.
